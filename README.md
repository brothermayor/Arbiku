## Why We Built Arbiku

Arbitrage trading is powerful but almost impossible for normal traders — prices change in seconds, bots are complex, and many require you to give up your funds.
We solve this by using an AI-powered bot built on Raiku that scans Solana DEXs for price gaps and executes profitable trades automatically while keeping users’ funds safe in their wallets.
